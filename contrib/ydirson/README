guesslang <list of root chunks>
		Attempts to set the @language of given root chunks.
		Note: Currently only inspects '#!' lines, not filename.
inheritlang
		Propagates @language to non-root chunks.
enscript-html <enscript flags>
		Uses enscript(1) to pretty-print chunks in HTML according to @language.
		Most useful enscript flags include --color and --style=...

		Note: Should ultimately work with all languages
		supported by enscript, but needs extra info about how
		to mangle @use clauses.  If it complains "Don't know
		how to mangle @use" for your language, you can edit
		mangle_use() and demangle_use() to turn the @use
		clause into a meaningfull language clause, and then
		convert back in @use form.

		Note: Supports all highlighting styles of enscript
		1.6.4, but the regexp in demangle_use() may need to be
		adapted in the future.

Typical use lokks like:
	noweave -html \
          -filter "guesslang ${NOWEBOUTSRC} | inheritlang | enscript-html" \ 
          -x <your.nw>

Be sure to specify -x or possibly other filters *after* the -filter,
since the pretty-printer does not preserve the position of remaining
directives (esp. @xref) within code chunks.
