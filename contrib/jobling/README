Correct-refs:
============

A set of awk scripts and to correct the internal anchors and links
produced by noweave -latex+html followed by latex2html. 

This is necessary because the design of the html back-ends for
noweave assume that the resulting HTML file will be the single
document produced by latex2html -split 0 but this is not such
a good idea if the document is large (e.g. the nuweb example).
By default latex2html will split documents into nodes at
section boundaries --- but if the document contains links,
the names have to be changed from "#name" to "noden.html#name".

The full documentation is contained in correct-refs.nw. Comments
