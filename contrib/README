These directories contain software that was contributed by users of
noweb.  Each directory contains a file called `email' that has the
email address of the contributor.  I don't pretend to have copyright
rights, and I don't provide any warranty or any support.  If you find
something useful here, we're both pleased.

Some contributed software contains binaries or is too big to be
included in the standard noweb distribution.  In such cases, the
directories here may contain only pointers to anonymous ftp sites.
