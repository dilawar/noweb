How to install noweb 2.7a in a PC386 or above running Dos if you have Mortice
Kern Systems' MKS Toolkit 4.2 for Dos. The rest of the software can be obtained
by ftp (GNU DJGPP, Icon binaries, LaTeX2e, GhostScript). Complete details on
how to get and install everything are provided

   a) Look at filelist.txt, and if you need something look at ftpsites.txt
   b) To install noweb if you are lucky you just have to edit 'myenv.ksh' and
      to run it, e.g. from the Ms-Dos command.com prompt do:
	cd noweb\contrib\avs
	edit myenv.ksh
	sh -c ./myenv.ksh
	automate
   c) Test the installation by doing (from the Korn shell prompt):
	cd noweb/src/tex
	noweb support.nw
	latex support
	latex support
	latex support
	v support
		(assuming your dvi viewer is a batch file called v.bat)
	dvips -o support.ps support
   d) See if you have the same problem as I do. If section 2.2 is missing 
      from page 7, chunk 9b from page 9 and chunk 28b from page 28 then
      you also have that problem that some code/doc chunks come out as white
      space. The current fix is to add a newline at the start/end of the chunk
      to make a paragraph. See report1.bug
   e) Further technical details on howto386.txt

If using this recipe you still run into trouble contact me. As a last resort
I'm willing to supply you by anonymous ftp with everything you need to run 
noweb 2.7a (except the MKS toolkit which is commercial software, i.e. I can 
supply binaries for LaTeX2e, Icon 9.0 and Noweb 2.7 that fit in 4 * 1.44 MB 
floppies)

My recipe has only been tested in my machine (which is heavily loaded, dozens 
of TSR's and has recent versions of most software). I will appreciate receiving
comments that allow it to run smoothly in other environments
