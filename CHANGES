Changed \filename to \nwfilename to avoid conflicts with some latex2e packages
Help for the most frequent problems now in INSTALL.
Fixed a bug that bit noweave -index when there are multiple definitions
	 of an identifier; tag of first defn was repeated instead of

noweave -html -x was producing local index stuff, but it shouldn't.
Decided -html shouldn't disable -noindex in noweave script

Changed notangle internally so it doesn't complain 
	if a chunk doesn't end with a newline (possible with nufront)
changed noweave so -index no longer forces a latex wrapper
Changed noidx so it won't use HTML specials in unique ids
Changes tohtml not to quote HTML in chunk names

Added -v option to noweave to show the pipeline.
A preliminary Noweb Hacker's Guide.

CHANGES FOR VERSION 2.6b

Added -autodefs c

Changed installation procedure so that source is no longer distributed
with contributed software --- you now must install noweb, then build
contributed software.

Bug fixes:

 - Makefile didn't create .../man/man1
 - noweave botched -x option, emitted index info anyway
 - markup complained, incorrectly, about [[<<]] in documentation.
 - noidx died if it tripped over an identifier used only in quoted code
 - tohtml wasn't inserting doc anchor into above_defns, so some xrefs
   that should have read `above' were coming out `below'
 - when one identifier was a prefix of another, as in
   Class and Class::member, finduses duplicated the prefix.


CHANGES FOR VERSION 2.6a

Fix bug in finduses that bit on the HP snake.

CHANGES FOR VERSION 2.6

For the HTML support
  - Invented lots of new @xref markup to support cross-referencing and
    indexing in a formatter-independent way.
  - Rewrote noidx and totex to push cross-reference and index support into
    the back end.
  - Adapted an HTML back end contributed by Bill Trost
Dave Love provided the bug fixes for latex2e.

CHANGES FOR VERSION 2.5:

Improved Source Code

Several parts of the source code have been rewritten in noweb.  I
especially call your attention to the contents of the shell, lib, and
tex directories.  Reading tex/support.nw will help you tinker with
formatting. 


Enhanced Latex Support

Includes INCOMPATIBLE changes to options accepted by noweave (and
noweave's default behavior).  noweb now supports an index of
identifiers and identifier cross-reference in a language-independent
way.  For more information, see the man page for noweave, especially
the -index option.   The man page for noindex tells how to build
indexes for large, multi-file documents.

I have added a `noweb' command that acts much like Preston Briggs's
`nuweb'; it extracts all the source programs and also writes a LaTeX
document with full cross-referencing.  See the man page for details.

latex support has been improved by changes to noweave, the noweave
cross-referencer, and the noweb document-style option.  Dave Love and
Jon Krom provided impetus for some of these changes in the best
possible way; they sent code.  Improvements include:
  -- noweave now generates latex headers by default.
  -- Code chunks are broken across pages only when they are more than
     a page long. (Thanks to Dave Love.)
  -- Thanks to Dave Love, cross-referenced definitions that appear on
     the same page are now numbered 7a, 7b, 7c, etc. (optionally 7.1,
     7.2, 7.3, or just plain 7; see the noweave man page).
  -- There is a `noweb' pagestyle, which puts source-file names and
     dates on the header line.  It is the default page style for noweave.
  -- noweave inserts no extra newlines, so the line numbers are the
     same in the .tex and .nw files (Dave Love's suggestion; a major win).
  -- By using noweave -delay, you can put a latex preamble in the
     first documentation chunk, and noweave will delay \filename and
     \begindocs until after the preamble, which becomes a WEB-like
     ``limbo'' area (suggested by Dave Love, Jon Krom, and others).
  -- noweave now has a -filter option that lets you name a
     cross-referencer or prettyprinter on the command line.
     You can try Jon Krom's cross-referencer by using 
	noweave -filter $LIB/noxref.krom
  -- notangle has a -filter option that you can use to implement
     slightly different semantics, such as Knuth's ``...''
     abbreviation convention. 
  -- The awk version of the cross-referencer is now almost as good as
     the Icon version; the sole remaining difference is that the Icon
     version ignores case when sorting; the awk version does not.
  -- Bug fixes in noweave's handling of special characters in chunk names.
  -- Many of the shell and awk scripts are now noweb files.
  -- \chunklist is now \nowebchunks, and it need not appear on a line
     by itself.  \nowebindex provides an index.
  -- The TeX support is now somewhat documented; see tex/support.nw
  -- Support for latex's New Font Selection Scheme (whatever that is),
     thanks again to Dave Love.
  
Finally, Kostas Oikonomou has contributed a simple prettyprinter for
Icon programs, and Conrado Martinez-Parra has contributed a
prettyprinter for Dijkstra's language of guarded commands.  I have
made both suitable for use with noweave -filter.


Bug Fix

The code that was supposed to prevent a chunk from including itself
didn't work at all.  So
<<*>>=
Forever <<*>>
@ made notangle very unhappy.
