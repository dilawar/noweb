.SH NAME
nowebfilters \- filters and parsers for use with noweb
.SH SYNOPSIS
[\fBnoweave\fP|\fBnotangle\fP|\fBnoweb\fP]
[\fB\-filter\fP \fIfilter\fP|\fB\-markup\fP \fIparser\fP] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This man page documents the various filters and parsers that are 
supplied with 
.IR noweb (1).
A filter, which transforms the pipeline representation, is used with the
.B \-filter
option.
A parser, which reads a source file and emits the pipeline representation,
is used with the
.B \-markup
option.
Not all filters and parsers are available at all installations.
.SH FILTERS
.TP
.B autodefs.*
.I noweave's
.B \-autodefs
and 
.B \-showautodefs
options use these filters, which automatically find defined identifiers.
The 
.B *
stands for the name of a programming language.
(Icon installation only.)
.TP
.B btdefn
The
.B btdefn
filter uses Dave Hanson's convention to mark definitions.
In code chunks, each defining instances of an identifier should be preceded by 
a single backtick character (ASCII 140).
The
.B btdefn
filter removes these backticks from the code and converts them to definitions,
thus:
.BR "`definition".
It, not
.BR "@ %def" ,
should be used with both 
.IR notangle (1)
and
.IR noweave (1),
at least for programs written in C-like languages.
.TP
.B disambiguate
The 
.B disambiguate 
filter makes it possible to abbreviate chunk names using a trailing ellipsis
(three periods), in the style of WEB and 
.IR nuweb (1).
.TP
.BI docs2comments " options"
The
.B docs2comments
filter converts documentation chunks to comments in code chunks.
Options include 
.BR "\-all" ,
which converts all documentation chunks into comments;
.B "\-one" 
converts only one documentation chunk preceding each code chunk.
The
.BI "\-w" k
option formats comments 
.I k
columns wide.
.IP
Other options control the language and style of the comment.
Languages available include
.BR      "\-awk" , 
.BR      "\-c" ,
.BR      "\-c++" ,
.BR      "\-f77" ,
.BR      "\-f90" ,
.BR      "\-icn" , 
.BR      "\-icon" ,
.BR      "\-lisp" , 
.BR      "\-m3" ,
.BR      "\-ml" , 
.BR      "\-ocamlweb" ,
.BR      "\-pascal" ,
.BR      "\-scm" ,
and
.BR      "\-tex" .
.IP
Norman recommends using
.BR notangle (1)
with
.B docstocomments
instead of
.BR nountangle (1).
(Icon installation only.)
.TP
.B elide \fIpatterns\fP
The
.B elide
filter
removes from the stream any code chunk matching 
any of the arguments.
Each argument is a pattern in which
.B ?
matches any single character and
.B * matches any sequence of characters.
.TP
.B emptydefn
The 
.B emptydefn
filter makes an empty definition (\fB<<>>=\fP) an abbreviation for
a continuation of the previous definition.
.TP 
\fBl2h\fP [\fB\-show\-unknowns\fP]
The 
.B l2h
filter converts LaTeX to HTML in documentation chunks.
If the \fB\-show\-unknowns\fP options is given, unrecognized LaTeX control
sequences appear in bold in the output.
.B l2h
uses the LaTeX-generated .toc and .bbl files to help create table of contents
and bibliography.
(Icon installation only.)
.TP
.B pipedocs\fI command\fP
The 
.B pipedocs
filter runs each documentation chunk through an invocation of
.IR command ,
which may be any Unix command.
The Noweb library includes the command
.BR h2a ,
which uses 
.IR lynx (1)
to convert HTML to 
ASCII.
.TP
.BI xchunks " files"
The 
.B xchunks
filter pulls in code chunks from an external source.
The
.I files
argument lists one or more noweb files, which are used only for their 
definitions of code chunks.
Empty chunk definitions in the main document are replaced with 
the external definitions of the same name.
This filter makes it possible to include the same code chunks 
in multiple documents, or even the same code chunks multiple 
times in the same document.
(Icon installation only.)
.SH PARSERS
A parser converts a source file to the noweb pipeline format,
interpreting the ``markup'' in that file.
By default, the tools use the standard noweb markup, but some installations
may support nuweb markup as well.
Parsers include
.TP
.B markup
Converts standard
.IR noweb (1)
markup to pipeline format.
.TP
.B numarkup
Converts 
.IR nuweb (1)
markup to noweb pipeline format.
It is not part of the standard installation, but it can be found in \fInoweb\fP's 
.B contrib/norman
directory.
.SH FILES
All filters and parsers are stored in
.B |LIBDIR|
.SH BUGS
It is possible to tell
.B l2h
about new control sequences by putting special TeX comments in one's 
documentation chunks, but there's no documentation.
Use the source, Luke.
.PP
.B numarkup
loses information, e.g., about the proper treatment of tabs.
It also doesn't compensate for \fInotangle\fP's newline-removal
heuristic, which means results on 
.I nuweb
files may differ subtly from those produced by 
.I nuweb.
.PP
Many filters are not available in installations that use Awk instead of Icon.
