       _N_o_w_e_b is a literate-programming tool like _F_u_n_n_e_l_W_E_B or _n_u_w_e_b, only sim-
       pler.  A _n_o_w_e_b file contains program source code interleaved with docu-
       mentation.  When _n_o_w_e_b is invoked, it writes the program source code to
       the output files mentioned in the noweb file, and it writes a _T_e_X  file
       for typeset documentation.

       The  _n_o_w_e_b(1) command is for people who don't like reading man pages or
       who are switching from _n_u_w_e_b.  To get the most out of _n_o_w_e_b, use _n_o_t_a_n_-
       _g_l_e(1) and _n_o_w_e_a_v_e(1) instead.

       A _n_o_w_e_b file is a sequence of _c_h_u_n_k_s, which may appear in any order.  A
       chunk may contain code or documentation.   Documentation  chunks  begin
       with a line that starts with an at sign (@) followed by a space or new-
       line.  They have no names.  Code chunks begin with
       <<_c_h_u_n_k _n_a_m_e>>=
       on a line by itself.  The double left angle bracket (<<) must be in the
       first column.  Chunks are terminated by the beginning of another chunk,
       or by end of file.  If the first line in the file  does  not  mark  the
       beginning  of a chunk, it is assumed to be the first line of a documen-
       tation chunk.

       Documentation chunks contain text that is copied verbatim  to  the  _T_e_X
       file (except for quoted code).  _n_o_w_e_b works with _L_a_T_e_X; the first docu-
       mentation chunk must contain a _L_a_T_e_X \\ddooccuummeennttccllaassss  command,  it  must
       contain  \\uusseeppaacckkaaggee{{nnoowweebb}}  in  the preamble, and finally it must also
       contain a _L_a_T_e_X \\bbeeggiinn{{ddooccuummeenntt}} command.

       Code chunks contain program source code and references  to  other  code
       chunks.  Several code chunks may have the same name; _n_o_w_e_b concatenates
       their definitions to produce a single chunk, just  as  other  literate-
       programming  tools do.  _n_o_w_e_b looks for chunks that are defined but not
       used in the source file.  If the name  of  such  a  chunk  contains  no
       spaces,  the  chunk  is an ``output file;'' _n_o_w_e_b expands it and writes
       the result onto the file of the same name.  A code-chunk definition  is
       like  a macro definition; it contains references to other chunks, which
       are themselves expanded, and so on.  _n_o_w_e_b's  output  is  readable;  it
       preserves the indentation of expanded chunks with respect to the chunks
       in which they appear.

       If a star (**) is appended to the name of an output file, _n_o_w_e_b includes
       line-number  information  as specified by the --LL_f_o_r_m_a_t option (or for C
       if no --LL_f_o_r_m_a_t option is given).  The name itself may not contain shell
       metacharacters.

       Code may be quoted within documentation chunks by placing double square
       brackets ([[[[_._._.]]]]) around it.  These double square brackets are used to
       give the code special typographic treatment in the _T_e_X file.  If quoted
       code ends with three or more square brackets, _n_o_w_e_b chooses the  right-
       most pair, so that, for example, [[[[aa[[ii]]]]]] is parsed correctly.

       In  code,  noweb treats unpaired double left or right angle brackets as
       literal <<<< and >>>>.  To force any such brackets, even paired brackets or
       brackets in documentation, to be treated as literal, use a preceding at
       sign (e.g. @@<<<<).

              used.)  _f_o_r_m_a_t is as defined by _n_o_t_a_n_g_l_e(1);

              on  files  in  other  formats;  for example, the nnuummaarrkkuupp parser
              understands  _n_u_w_e_b(1)  format.   See  _n_o_w_e_b_f_i_l_t_e_r_s(7)  for  more
              information.  For experts only.

BBUUGGSS
       Ignoring  unused  chunks  whose  names  contain spaces sometimes causes
       problems, especially in the case when a chunk has multiple  definitions
       and  one  is  misspelled;  the  misspelled  definition will be silently
       ignored.  _n_o_r_o_o_t_s(1) can be used as a sanity checker to catch this sort
       of mistake.

       _n_o_w_e_b  is intended for users who don't want the power or the complexity
       of command-line options.  More sophisticated users should  avoid  _n_o_w_e_b
       and  use  _n_o_w_e_a_v_e  and _n_o_t_a_n_g_l_e instead.  If the design were better, we
       could all use the same commands.

       _n_o_w_e_b requires the new version of _a_w_k, assumed to be called _n_a_w_k.   DEC
       _n_a_w_k  has a bug in that that causes problems with braces in _T_e_X output.
       GNU _g_a_w_k is reported to work.

       The default _L_a_T_e_X pagestyles don't set the width of the boxes  contain-
       ing  headers  and footers.  Since _n_o_w_e_b code paragraphs are extra wide,
       this _L_a_T_e_X bug sometimes results in  extra-wide  headers  and  footers.
       The  remedy  is  to  redefine  the  relevant ppss@@** commands; ppss@@nnoowweebb in
       nnoowweebb..ssttyy can be used as an example.
